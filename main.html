<h3>Who Was Clara?</h3>

<p id="bio-section">Clara Donay (born Jan 30, 1961) was the second oldest daughter of 6 children to Eddie and Pete Frazier. Clara has three children: Eric, Toni, and Brittany. Clara was all about her family and naturally, her family was all about her. She gave the best hugs, had the ability to make your face hurt from laughing, and made THE BEST macaroni and cheesepockets you ever had. </p>

<h3>Memories and Anedotes</h3>

<p>"Dodie practiced a lot of her hair cuts and styles on me. I remember she had to take some kind of test or something when she worked at that place in Lyles Mall and I was her model. I can’t remember what exactly she had to do for her exam, but the instructor was walking around and checking everything they were doing. SOMETIMES Claire could be a little heavy handed, but I couldn’t say anything, I just smiled when that lady came and checked out her work….and she passed" - Kita</p>

<p>"I am the oldest of 6 children but Andy was always the most responsible one that made sure that things got done before ma got up. I didn’t mind cause I got to spend more time with my friends. Whenever Andy would remind me that I was the oldest and should be doing the things that she was I’d tell her that I didn’t have any kids and go on about my business. It wasn’t until we started having children ourselves when I woke up and realized the meaning of being the big sister and try to live my life by example of what big sister does. Andy and I were talking on the phone one day and she told me that she was always wanted a big sister and she was glad to have me as her big sister and friend. That’s a comment that I will never forget" - Roshelle </p>

<p>"She would laugh at how Jonece Nia & Leslie would break our dancing in the store. She would say Chel look at your girls. They just break our dancing anywhere." - Mechel</p>

<p>"Dodie was my confidant. Anything I wanted to do she would encourage me to do and support me by watching the girls. Fixing them dinner while I study, giving me a break to focus on school.</p>

  <p>I remember when I wanted to get into healthcare and I quit my job to go to school to be a medical assistant. She didn’t question me she just point me out to resources that could help me out while I was in school.</p>
  <p>One thing for sure was when she was in the hospital…she would give nurses the blues. She was nice but didn’t take no shit! I would say Dodie be kind to the nurses wouldn’t you want people to be kind to me. I’m that would help her change her mind.</p>
  <p>I know during this last days she she wanted to be sure that me & Toni White were going to be ok. We had to tell her that we had each other for support.</p>
  <p>HAIR was her hobby…she loved it. Up until the end she fixed her own hair. One of the dopest stylist in Louisville.</p>
  <p>Dodie was a very spiritual woman. Her and I had many many conversations about life, death and the afterlife. She loved watching the paranormal shows. One time I asked her “girl are you watching these shoes to see how to come back after your gone?” She said Yep….and I believed her!</p>
  <p>I can go on and on and on. To know her is to love her!" - Mechel </p>
